        summary:
          Lead developer for the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and Super Resolution for Renewable Energy Resource Data (SUP3R). NSRDB integrates MERRA-2 reanalysis data, GOES satellite observations, and physical modeling to generate high-resolution solar resource data, and has 300,000+ annual users from 50+ countries. SUP3R leverages generative machine learning to produce high-resolution meteorological data, with applications in wind and solar resource data generation and climate projections, and has users from 50+ institutions and 20+ countries.
        highlights:
          - Optimized NSRDB pipeline, reducing reprocessing time by 80%
          - Extended NSRDB coverage from 60Â°N to full polar region, broadening its applicability.
          - Incorporated temperature-sensitive snowy albedo model into NSRDB to improve surface radiation accuracy.
          - Developed cloud property estimation and radiative transfer models to enhance NSRDB data fidelity.
          - Publicly released SUP3R framework, consisting of comprehensive suite for feature engineering, data handling, model prototyping, training, and inference.
          - Developed novel GAN-based downscaling methods for SUP3R project, increasing speed of downscaling 300x over dynamical approaches.
          - Led applications of SUP3R to generate high-resolution wind resource data over Ukraine, Southeast Asia, and South America from coarse ERA5 inputs.
          - Applied SUP3R to produce high-resolution climate projections for the US and assess impact of urban heat islands on energy demand.
